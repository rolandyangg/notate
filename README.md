### Direct Image Paste

Easily paste images directly from your clipboard into the editor and be able to annotate and draw on it with the same tools as a normal drawing canvas. Also supports file upload.

### Spacebar Draw

To combat the clunkiness of having to hold down the trackpad on keyboards while drawing, you can hold down spacebar and trace with your mouse to draw for ease of annotation and drawing.

### Drag and Drop Comments

Add movable comments onto a specific block or part of the canvas by clicking and dragging from the location to create a comment box at that point.

Can be activated by pressing `Tab + C` or accessing the feature from the external annotations menu in the top right.

### Scribble Tool

### Import/Export

Seamlessly import or export your work as JSON files to save progress or share across platforms. 

Done in JSON format to preserve the annotations data so when you import it back in you have all the same exact editable annotations/drawings and you can may edit them as well.

Can be activated by utilizing the import/export menu in the bottom right.
